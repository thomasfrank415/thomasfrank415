<p>Hi, I’m Thomas Frank.</p>	
<p>I'm a passionate Data Analyst / Scientist with over 7 years of professional experience, first in the Environmental Engineering field and now in the Data Science industry.</p> 
<p>I’m self-taught in SQL and Python and have since honed my skills after joining Seek as a Digital Analyst (Product Analytics) in 2021 where I complete complex queries (CTE's, Window Functions, etc.) to deliver insights using rich datasets while working alongside a high calibre team of data analysts embedded into fully resourced product teams.</p>
<p>You can reach me at thomasfrank415@gmail.com</p>
