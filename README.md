<p>Hi, I’m Thomas Frank.</p>	
<p>I'm a passionate Data Scientist with over 7 years of professional experience, first in the Environmental Engineering field and now in the Tech Industry.</p> 
<p>​I’m self-taught in SQL and Python and honed my skills after joining the tech industry as a Data Analyst in 2021 at Seek (The leading online employment marketplace in the Asia Pacific) before a move into a role as a Data Scientist in 2022 at Canva (an online design and publishing tool with a mission to empower everyone in the world to design anything and publish anywhere). I currently work at S&P Global as a Business Inteligence Data Analyst in Denver, Colorado and am completing my Masters of Data Science with UNSW to expand my data skills, continue learning more advanced data techniques and explore my love of Artificial Intelligence further.</p>
